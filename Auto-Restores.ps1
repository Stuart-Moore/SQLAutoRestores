A set of functions that should make life easier to automate SQL Server restores and testing
of the resulting databases.

The aim is to build something flexible and robust for general usage. The basis is scripts
I've written for particular environments/$EMPLOYERS so need expanding.

This is a work in progress. Refer to the ToDo file for where I'm planning on heading

Please feel free to make suggestions/corrections,
